only posts table for keeping posts
op_id is 0 if it is op, otherwise it is a reply and refers to corresponding post

posts (
    id,
    board,
    op_id,
    time,
    name,
    title
)

select for threads list:
    SELECT * FROM posts WHERE posts.board="${board}" AND op_id=0;
select for thread:
    SELECT * FROM posts WHERE posts.op_id=${id};

so there is only one table with all posts
